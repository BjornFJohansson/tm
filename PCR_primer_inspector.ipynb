    "## State of the art for PCR primer melting temperature (tm) calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "This document was prepared to gather information about what might be the latest most modern and \n",
    "accurate ways to calculate PCR primer melting temperature (Tm) and PCR annealing temperature (Ta) in 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am the developer of the python package pydna and my main motivation is to provide up to date methods for the pydna package.\n",

    "The authors maintain a web server called [dnaMATE](http://melolab.org/dnaMATE). The accompanying website contain interesting references.\n",

    "The methods in pydna are based on biopython code in the [Bio.SeqUtils.MeltingTemp](https://biopython.org/docs/1.83/api/Bio.SeqUtils.MeltingTemp.html) module.

    "A superficial inspection of PCR Primer Inspector reveals that the methods are relatively well documented compared to many other online tools. Clicking on the question mark next to each argument displays a page of text regarding the calculation.\n",
